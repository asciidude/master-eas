# MasterEAS
## The ultimate standalone Emergency Alert System menu built for FiveM.

MasterEAS was particularly designed to make Emergency Alert Systems (EAS) accessible to classic FiveM servers that use standalone plugins and something like vMenu. This has been particularly engineered for a combination of plugin quality and stability.
